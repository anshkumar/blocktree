\b0 \
Corruption in India is an issue that adversely affects the country's economy and the credibility of central, state and local government agencies. In government schools books and supplies are sometimes sold instead of being given out freely, in government hospitals doctors not attending patients are some of the most common problems. \

\b Proposed solution
\b0 \
We propose a solution to all such similar problems using a consumer-based proof-of-work system. In this system all the transactions are made transparent and messages are broadcast on a best-effort basis by a newspaper or local news channel. Consumers are divided into a small blocks headed by an institution or a doctor. All the consumer within the block are given right to vote similar to a single transferable voting system. Votes from each blocks are normalized and are arranged to form a tree like structure called the blocktree.\

\b Scalability
\b0 \
Single transferable voting system with transparent transactions is very much scalable and can be implemented in any department (by knowing its working). Corruption can be traced back from the consumer end to the source of transaction.\

\b Scope
\b0 \
Education system, health-care system, government offices etc. (any system where transaction is made for the benefit of mass).\
